## Overview

**Eformation** is a full-stack e-learning web application developed to support digital education through a clean, scalable, and user-friendly platform.  
The application allows students to access structured courses and learning materials, while administrators manage content and users efficiently.

The project was built with a strong separation between the front-end and back-end to ensure maintainability and future scalability.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication & Authorization**  
  Secure authentication system with role-based access using JWT.

- **Course & Content Management**  
  Administrators can create, edit, and organize courses and educational resources.

- **Student Learning Experience**  
  Users can browse courses, access learning content, and follow structured educational paths.

- **Responsive User Interface**  
  Modern and responsive UI built with Tailwind CSS, optimized for all screen sizes.

- **RESTful Communication**  
  Reliable interaction between front-end and back-end through REST APIs.

---

## Technologies Used

- **React.js** – Front-end development with reusable components  
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first styling for fast and consistent UI  
- **Spring Boot** – Back-end development with RESTful services  
- **PostgreSQL** – Relational database for structured data storage  
- **JWT** – Secure authentication and authorization  
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control and project management  

---

## Architecture

The project follows a layered architecture:
- **Presentation Layer**: React user interface  
- **Business Layer**: Spring Boot services  
- **Data Layer**: JPA repositories with PostgreSQL  

This structure improves code readability, scalability, and maintainability.
